The goal of this c++ library is to help you to make worms, bots, or hacking tools.

It was written for educational and recreational purposes only.

You're free to use this library in your softwares.

Most of the code come from Metasploit, agobot, caberp... or internet.

Most of the code is badly coded and not optimize at all, but it's only the first version.
